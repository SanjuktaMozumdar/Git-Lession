Introduction to Git:
---------------------

Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
	. Have the local copy of the code
	. Also, the entire commit history
	. easy to use

Staging Area - Files in the Staging area will be tracked by Git. Apart from the files in the staging area, Git ignores other files.

Commit History - Everytime we commit, we create a new version of the file.

** We need to add the files to the Staging area before Commiting

-------------
Git Commands: open git bash/ cmd in the current working directory
------------- 

1. [git init] -> (it initialise and create empty git repository)
2. [git init -b main] -> (for initializing and making it a specific branch)
3. [git add <fileName>] -> (this adds the mentioned file to the staging area and it will be tracked by Git)
4. [git commit -m "commit message"] -> (for commiting or saving the file. We need to add the tracing message)
5. [git log] -> (returns the commit history)
6. [git status] -> (returns the status of the current working files)
7. [git commit -a -m "message"] -> (adding command to directly commit, skipping the staging area)
8. [git diff] -> (return the difference in [last commit or staging area] and [current file in working directory])
9. [git diff --staged] -> (returns the difference in [last commit] and [staging area])
10. [git add .] -> (this adds all the files present in the working directory to the staging area)
11. [git restore --staged <fileNme>] -> (to unstage a specific file from the staging area)

--------------
Git + Github
---------------
1. Create Repository at Github
2. Open gitBash
3. [ssh-keygen -o] -> (to generate ssh-key, It requests to set id and password)
4. goto the mentioned location where .ssh file is created
5. in cmd open id_rsa.pub
6. copy the ssh key
7. goto github > settings > SSH and GPG keys > add SSH key
8. [git remote add origin <ssh link from the newly created repository>]
9. [git remote -v] -> (return the github  fetch and push link)
10. [git push origin main] -> (pushing local repository to remote)
