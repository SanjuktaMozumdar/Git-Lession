Introduction to Git:
---------------------

Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
	. Have the local copy of the code
	. Also, the entire commit history
	. easy to use

Staging Area - Files in the Staging area will be tracked by Git. Apart from the files in the staging area, Git ignores other files.

Commit History - Everytime we commit, we create a new version of the file.

** We need to add the files to the Staging area before Commiting

-------------
Git Commands: open git bash/ cmd in the current working directory
------------- 

1. [git init] -> (it initialise and create empty git repository)
2. [git init -b main] -> (for initializing and making it a specific branch)
3. [git add <fileName>] -> (this adds the mentioned file to the staging area and it will be tracked by Git)
4. [git commit -m "commit message"] -> (for commiting or saving the file. We need to add the tracing message)
5. [git log] -> (returns the commit history)
6. [git status] -> (returns the status of the current working files)
7. [git commit -a -m "message"] -> (adding command to directly commit, skipping the staging area)
8. [git diff] -> (return the difference in [last commit or staging area] and [current file in working directory])
9. [git diff --staged] -> (returns the difference in [last commit] and [staging area])
10. [git add .] -> (this adds all the files present in the working directory to the staging area)
